            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Data protection law defines some personal information as "special categories of data". This includes information about physical or mental health, sexual life, religious beliefs, race or ethnic origin, political opinions, trade union membership or biometric data. Some of this information may be necessary to collect when understanding the reason for your financial circumstances, or where it may help us to provide a better service to you and obtain a better understanding of your financial situation. For example, a period of ill health could have caused you to fall behind with your regular payments to your creditors.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Where we need to collect and process this type of data about you, by providing this information to us you give your explicit consent for us and any other third party to process this special data as set out in this privacy policy, unless we have a legal obligation to process this type of data.
